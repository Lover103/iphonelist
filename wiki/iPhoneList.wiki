= Introduction =

I want a fully functional GUI into the iPhone file system. This program is based on Manzana, Peter Dennis Bartok's C# class-library implementation of some of the work done by the #iphone-dev jailbreak and iphoneinterface teams. 


= Details =

Not much here yet, but more to come...
I only have the basic GUI working. I added file details that were missing in ManzanaUI.

I use a different model than ManzanaUI in that I poll for the iPhone connection. I couldn't maintain GUI editing control within VS2005 the way ManzanaUI was coded, so I created a GUI from scratch, borrowing pieces of code from ManzanaUI and putting a lot of my own GUI ideas there.

If you want to help out...
